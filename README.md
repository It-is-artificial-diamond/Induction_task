# Induction_task
induction task for club

Had fun doing these tasks, always wanted to know how to plot graphs, didnt know matplotlib was a thing
For the 1st question, i used your reference video, which was the 9th video from a playlist. i saw a few more videos from the playlist and this helped me understand the basics of matplotlib.
i then saw a few other miscellaneous videos about plots subplots loc(), iloc() . didn't need much help from others because the code was in the video itself, just had to understand, apply changes, and write it down

For the 2nd task, your playlit was too big, so i saw miscellaneous videos about arduinos, then finally made the connections to the microcontroller.
as for the actual code, the max-analog-reading was supposed to be 1023, but i was getting only till 914, so i had no choice other than to take help from gpt, 
as my force sensor wasn't properly registering the values, and therby the buzzer min and max was not being achieved
other than this, i went to the arduino language reference page and read the various functions and stuff. there are a lot of miscellaneous sources , so i cant list all of them
